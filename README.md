🔹 Project Title

High-Performance and Power-Efficient 16-bit ALU Using Carry Select Adder (CSLA) Architecture with Clock Gating

🔹 Overview

This project implements a high-performance and power-efficient 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in Verilog HDL. A Carry Select Adder (CSLA) architecture is used to reduce the critical path delay for arithmetic operations, while clock gating is applied to minimize dynamic power consumption by disabling unnecessary switching during inactive operation modes.

🔹 Architecture Details

Supports arithmetic and logical operations including:

Addition

Subtraction

Bitwise AND

Bitwise OR

Bitwise XOR

Bitwise NOT

Addition and subtraction are implemented using a modular 16-bit Carry Select Adder (CSLA) to improve speed.

Clock gating is implemented to disable clock to internal registers when ALU operations are not required, thereby reducing switching activity and dynamic power.

Hierarchical and modular RTL design for easy debugging and reuse.# ALU_using_verilog
